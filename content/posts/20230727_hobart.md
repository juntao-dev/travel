Upcoming trip to Hobart, 4 days from 27 July 2023.

It has been years since I arrived at Melbourne as a student. Much of my focus in those following years were split between my degree and immigration. Money, of course, has its role to play as well. Maybe I can add COVID to the list as well if I am making a blame list.

Excuses aside, I miss travelling. The excitements, unknowns, strangers, exhaustions, amazingly good & awful food, and the simplest feeling of opening up to the world.

I have been around various spots in Victoria with family and friends. Last year, I also made small trips to Auckland, Sydney and Gold Coast.

With this trip to Hobart, I will attempt to bring my work laptop with me, so that I can work remotely for 2 days and explore the city in remaining durations.

Journey will be updated here, more to come.
